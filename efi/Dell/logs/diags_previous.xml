which is less than the recommended 65W power adapter. To continue operating
at peak performance, your system may also draw power from the battery. The
battery charges only when the power provided by the adapter is greater than the
needs of your system. Use a Dell 65W (or greater) power adapter to enable
charging during peak system performance.
